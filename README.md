# SORTPULSE - Sorting Visualizer

## Overview

This project is a dynamic visualization of popular sorting algorithms, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The tool provides an interactive way to understand how different sorting algorithms work by allowing users to visualize the process step by step. 

## Features

- **Algorithms Implemented:**
  - **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
  - **Selection Sort**: An in-place comparison sort that divides the list into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part, then repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.
  - **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly picking the next item and inserting it into the correct position within the sorted part.
  - **Quick Sort**: An efficient, comparison-based, divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot element and partitions the array into sub-arrays of elements less than and greater than the pivot, then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
  - **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and finally merges the sorted halves back together.

- **Customization Options:**
  - **Array Size**: Users can customize the size of the array to see how the algorithms perform on different data sets.
  - **Sorting Speed**: The speed of the visualization can be adjusted to observe the sorting process in more detail or at a faster pace.

- **Real-Time Metrics**: As the algorithms execute, real-time metrics are displayed to show the progress and behavior of the sorting process.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - **HTML**: Provides the structure of the application.
  - **CSS**: Adds styling to make the interface visually appealing and user-friendly.
  - **JavaScript**: Implements the sorting algorithms and handles user interaction.

## Usage

You can interact with the sorting visualizer by visiting the live website. Once there, you can:
- Select the sorting algorithm you want to visualize.
- Adjust the array size and sorting speed using the provided controls.
- Click on the "Generate New Array" button to create a new set of numbers to sort.
- Start the sorting process and watch how the algorithm sorts the array in real time.
